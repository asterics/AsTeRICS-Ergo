Ideas for FS20 support:
The user should be able to define action strings (housecode_address_action) for a button. But how to tell which button should send it?


Need Features/Improvements:
*)
SSE:
ARE should be able to send plugin errors with SSE: But actually it should work, because WebACS must also support this.
E.g. If the FS20 is not connected or cannot be started there should be an error message indicating the problem. The error message should be sent to the webclient through SSE.

*)
Add REST-function which supports setting an array of properties, because setting many properties is very annoying due to callBack mechanism.
