    There are 3 possibilities:
    <ol>
        <li>Check whether there is intervisibility between the IrTrans and the device (which you wish to control).<br/>
            <div class="col-xs-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                <img src="angular/envControl/img/irtrans_control.png" alt="IrTrans-USB directed at TV"/>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"/>
        </li>
        <li>Delete the commands, which do not work. Add them again using the button „new command“. Caution: It is
            important that the remote control points in the direction of the IrTrans (not the device) while setting up
            the control.<br/>
            <div class="col-xs-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                <img src="angular/envControl/img/HW_IRTRANS_USB_learn.png" alt="Remote control directed at IrTrans-USB"/>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"/>
        </li>
        <li>Delete the device and restart the setup.</li>
    </ol>
    You can delete devices or commands using the button “Activate Deleting” or via right-hand click.
