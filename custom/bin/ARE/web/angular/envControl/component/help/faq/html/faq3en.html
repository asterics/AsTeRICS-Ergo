<div>The required hardware depends on the devices, which you wish to control with AsTeRICS Ergo.
    Use the
    <a href="" ng-click="$ctrl.toState('asterics.envControl.STATE_HELP_DEVICES')">Order Wizard</a>
    to find out which additional hardware you need to acquire.
    <ol>
        <li>If you want to control a device, which you normally control using a remote control, you need to acquire an
            <a href=""ng-click="$ctrl.toState('asterics.envControl.STATE_HELP_IRTRANS')">IrTrans</a>. The IrTrans allows to replace remote commands. One IrTrans can control many remote control devices.
            Therefore you only need to acquire one IrTrans. No further hardware is needed. Please note that you also
            need to
            order a USB Type B cable, as this is not included in the order.
        </li>
        <li>If you want to control the ambient light via AsTeRICS Ergo, the conventional light bulb needs to be replaced
            with an <a href="" ng-click="$ctrl.toState('asterics.envControl.STATE_HELP_IRBULB')">IR light bulb</a>, which can be controlled with the IrTrans.
        </li>
        <li>If you want to control a device that is connected to a socket and is normally turned on and off with a
            switch
            (for example, a table lamp, a fan), you need the <a href=""ng-click="$ctrl.toState('asterics.envControl.STATE_HELP_FS20')">FS20-System</a>. The FS20 system allows to switch devices on
            and
            off. However, you cannot use more functions.
            Example: With the help of the FS20 system you can switch on the table lamp. However, you cannot control the
            brightness.
            An FS20 adapter is required for each device you wish to control with the FS20 system. Overall, one FS20
            transmitter is sufficient.
