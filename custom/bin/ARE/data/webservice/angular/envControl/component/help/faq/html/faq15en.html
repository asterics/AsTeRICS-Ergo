    There are 3 possibilities:
    <ol>
        <li>Check whether there is intervisibility between the IrTrans and the device (which you wish to control).
        </li>
        <li>Delete the commands, which do not work. Add them again using the button „new command“. Cation: It is
            important that the remote control points in the direction of the IrTrans (not the device) while setting up
            the control..
        </li>
        <li>Delete the device and restart the setup.</li>
    </ol>
    You can delete devices or commands using the button “Activate Deleting” or via right-hand click.
