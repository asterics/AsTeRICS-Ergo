<p>The program AsTeRICS Ergo can be downloaded and used free of charge. The costs for the needed hardware depend on the
    devices you wish to control. Usually you can expect costs between 100 € and 300 €.
</p>
<p><b>Hint:</b> If you order hardware via the Amazon links provided by AsTeRICS-Ergo (e.g. in <a
        ui-sref="home.envControl.help/faq({open: 28})">FAQ order links</a>), so 3% of the order costs go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asterics-foundation.org">AsTeRICS Foundation</a>.
    For you as customer the price is not higher because of this.
