<p>The required hardware depends on the devices, which you wish to control with AsTeRICS Ergo.
    Use the
    <a href="" ng-click="$ctrl.toState('asterics.envControl.STATE_HELP_DEVICES')">Order Wizard</a>.
    to find out which additional hardware you need to acquire.
<ol>
    <li>If you want to control a device, which you normally control using a remote control, you need to acquire an
        IrTrans. The IrTrans allows to replace remote commands. One IrTrans can control many remote control devices.
        Therefore you only need to acquire one IrTrans. No further hardware is needed. Please note that you also need to
        order a USB Type B cable, as this is not included in the order.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to control the ambient light via AsTeRICS Ergo, the conventional light bulbs need to be replaced
        with IR light bulbs. These can be controlled with the IrTrans.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to control a device that is connected to a socket and is normally turned on and off with a switch
        (for example, a table lamp, a fan), you need the FS20-system. The FS20 system allows to switch devices on and
        off. However, you cannot use more functions.
        Example: With the help of the FS20 system you can switch on the table lamp. However, you cannot control the
        brightness.
        An FS20 adapter is required for each device you wish to control with the FS20 system. Overall, one FS20
        transmitter is sufficient.
