In order to control a device using the FS20 system, the switch of the device must always point towards "on". The device should only be switched on and off using AsTeRICS Ergo or the grey button on the FS20 connector. Do not use the switch of the device, because otherwise it can no longer be controlled via AsTeRICS Ergo!
